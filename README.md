# Blocksense Oracle Data dApp

## Project Details

**Project Name:**  
Blocksense Oracle Data dApp

**Short Project Description:**  
A decentralized application (dApp) that reads data from Blocksense's catalogue of data feeds and displays it in real-time. The dApp includes features such as a dark mode toggle and wallet connection.

**Explanation of How Sponsor Tech Was Used:**  
This project utilizes Blocksense's oracle data feeds to fetch and display real-time cryptocurrency prices. The smart contract interacts with Blocksense's oracle to retrieve data, which is then displayed in the frontend.

**AI Tool Used:**  
ChatGPT was utilized for generating and refining documentation, helping with code structuring, and assisting with troubleshooting common issues.
